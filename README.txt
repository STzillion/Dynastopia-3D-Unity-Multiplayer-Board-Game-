/* - All the scripts below are for the 3D board game I developed in the Unity game engine using C-Sharp
    - Unity's C# syntax is a little bit different from other language syntaxes in that it supports more data types. 
    - Unlike just having data types such as String, Floats, Ints, Doubles, Boolean and Chars, Unity has GameObjects, Animators, Panels, etc as data types.
    - This should be helpful in identifying what does what.
    - Based on how long development time was and due to how unexperienced I was starting this project, there will be a lot of poor choices or less efficient ways to solve problems throughout the scripts
    - An example is the over reliance of if else statements, less comments explaining things, and not enough Methods.
    - However I hope you enjoy, and leave any questions you have to my email. This should be helpful if you're trying to make a 3D board game yourself.
